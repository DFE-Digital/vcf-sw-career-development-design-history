During the alpha phase we incurred a number of design items that we either did not have the time to address or needed content to make them more useful.

| Ref  | Item                        | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Why?                   | Status                                       |
|------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| DD1  | Homepage alternate routes   | The HP should reflect alternate routes into development programmes. No users interpreted programmes as a means to progress career. Make it clear what programmes are relevant and to whom.                                                                                                       | From research R2/R3    | **Incorporated into beta designs**           |
| DD2  | Development programme pages | The summary key at the top of the page tested well. Content is needed for this and should be retested.                                                                                                                                                                                           | From research R2       | **Incorporated into beta designs**           |
| DD3  | Development programme pages | Review updated content and decide which template is most suitable and usability test with users.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | From research R2       | **Incorporated into beta designs**           |
| DD4  | Pathways page               | Remove the arrows and design alternate presentation of this content. They added no value and were called out as being misleading as implying the pathway is completely linear.                                                                                                                   | From research R3       | **On hold**                                  |
| DD5  | Pathways page               | Add content to this page as per research findings. Help the user understand which level relates to them. They have to go into each one to find that out now.                                                                                                                                     | From research R3       | **On hold**                                  |
| DD6  | Pathways level page         | Users seemed to miss the content in the hero area. Decide an approach for titling of all pages. As per hero area item.                                                                                                                                                                           | From research R3       | **Removed hero from beta designs**           |
| DD7  | Level pages                 | Review use of steps. Are these useful? We need proper content. Also dependant on outcome of peer review / design crits etc.                                                                                                                                                                      | Needs validation       | **On hold**                                  |
| DD8  | Hero area                   | We currently have a hero area on some pages and not others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Inconsistent design    | **Limited to homepage currently**            |
| DD9  | DfE branding                | Apply the correct DfE branding (subject to where this is hosted).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Design in DfE guidance | **Done in prototype and Figma and approved** |
| DD10 | Design crit                 | We never had a design crit for any of this!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Design in DfE guidance | **Jim presented to design crew 14 Oct**      |
| DD11 | Upon content                | Update Upon content in content page with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ov605Jy2SS9wF1kBW4R65QqdlHDyzaKD3x31PMdSrAs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">updated version</a>.                                                                                                         | Content                | **Later sprints**                            |
| DD12 | Pathways programme content  | Add Pathways Programme content in content page with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DBxyIH9cqiH-tW3YYJ2Zi9tVaYT-lHTKIb_SJXR-gv0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">new version</a>.                                                                                                  | Content                | **Jim created and in testing**               |
| DD13 | Homepage comprehension      | Ensure content clearly explains positioning. The DfE is associated with school education and the lack of clarifying content mislead some users into thinking the service is focused on Social Work at schools or within DfE. Also make it clear the focus is Children and Family SW - not adult. | Content                | **Incorporated into beta designs**           |

Note: Items DD1 and DD13 were edited on 2 September 2022 once the round 3 research findings were available (for homepage and development programmes testing).
