During the alpha phase we incurred a number of design items that we either did not have the time to address or needed content to make them more useful. The following details that debt:

| Ref  | Item                        | Detail                                                                                                                                                                         | Why?                   |
|------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| DD1  | Homepage alternate routes   | The HP should reflect alternate route into development programmes.                                                                                                             | From research R2/R3    |
| DD2  | Development programme pages | The summary at the top of the page tested well. Content is needed for this and should be retested.                                                                             | From research R2       |
| DD3  | Development programme pages | Review updated content and decide which template is most suitable and usability test with users.                                                                               | From research R2       |
| DD4  | Pathways page               | Remove the arrows and design alternate presentation of this content. They added no value and were called out as being misleading as implying the pathway is completely linear. | From research R3       |
| DD5  | Pathways page               | Add content to this page as per research findings. Help the user understand which level relates to them. They have to go into each one to find that out now.                   | From research R3       |
| DD6  | Pathways level page         | Users seemed to miss the content in the hero area. Decide an approach for titling of all pages. As per hero area item.                                                         | From research R3       |
| DD7  | Level pages                 | Review use of steps. Are these useful? We need proper content. Also dependant on outcome of peer review / design crits etc.                                                    | Needs validation       |
| DD8  | Hero area                   | We currently have a hero area on some pages and not others.                                                                                                                    | Inconsistent design    |
| DD9  | DfE branding                | Apply the correct DfE branding (subject to where this is hosted).                                                                                                              | Design in DfE guidance |
| DD10 | Design crit                 | We never had a design crit for any of this!                                                                                                                                    | Design in DfE guidance |
