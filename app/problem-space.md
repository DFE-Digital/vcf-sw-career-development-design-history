## Background

The Department for Education wants to support Child & Family Social Workers to continuously improve the quality of their practice and encourage them to stay in child & family social work.

**Long-term focus**

In May 2022 the Independent Review into Children’s Social Care recommended an Early Career Pathway (ECP) to improve quality of front line practitioners with a focus on those in Child Protection roles.

This mandatory support package includes a pathway of development and assessments for newly qualified social workers through to Expert Child Protection practitioners.

Ministers have committed to this recommendation. Policy are planning how we roll this out nationally and how it fits with the wider DfE career journey services.

**Current focus**

Currently, to improve social worker knowlege and skills, DfE fund a number of national development programmes for social workers at all stages of their career (from newly qualified to senior leadership).

However:

- it’s not clear if this approach alone made a difference to practice and retention
- third party providers and local authorities;
  - provide fragmented and incomplete data DfE need to measure value and make improvements,
  - control the messaging about the programmes,
  - market and deliver digital components of the programmes at a high cost to DfE.

**Overarching business problems**

![The business problems](business-problems.png "The business problems")

**Vision**
*“ Give Child and Family social workers* ***access to the right opportunities*** *and* ***encourage them to proactively manage their learning & development*** *so they can* ***provide quality services*** *whilst continuing to* ***advance their careers within the profession.*** *”*


**What does the thing we launch first look like?**

![MVP](MVP.png "MVP")

We believe this would:
- Increase awareness of the DfE development programmes on offer.
- Increase sign ups to the DfE development programmes on offer.
- Reduce cost of marketing programmes through 3rd party providers.
- Increase awareness of the DfE as a provider of learning and development for Child & Family Social Workers.



![Post MVP proposed by the business](businessMVP.png "Post MVP proposed by the business")

We believe this would:
- make it easier for social workers to understand their career options
- reduce the burden of finding quality training and development.
- enable social workers to be self-sufficient with career guidance, reducing reliance on managers and LAs.
- create opportunities for DfE to deliver our programmes more efficiently.


## Understanding our users and their journeys

A borad discovery was conducted from July - Septemenr 2021 to better understand the child and family social work career development landscape and determine how the workforce strategy could be support by bringing user centred thinking.

A single concept of a Career Guidance service was created focusing on the user pains:
- not understanding what career options are available
- not understanding what is required for a different role and how to evidence it, either because they still need to build the skills, or they have the skills but don’t know how to demonstrate them during application


After a pause in the project, the Alpha phase commenced in May 2022 with a brand new digital team, workshops were held to re-map the new teams' understanding of the user journey, key pain points and opportunity areas. Adding in questions that could not bed answered from reviewing the discovery documentation.

## Creating the Problem Statements

Following our user journey mapping we formulated our user problem statments through a framing exercise.

As a team we noticed a discrepancy between the user problems and the solutions suggested by the business (DfE Policy Team). A workshop was held to better understand the business problems the DfE were trying to solve through the suggested ideas.

The Alpha scope was adjusted to incorporate key User Problems as well as the business problem of needing to showcase the DfE development programmes.

An updated set of problem statements were created to reflect the learnings from the workshops.

## Continuing to refine and expand our User Journeys in Private Beta 

In private beta we had two goals:

- Create, test and iterate content for our MVP service 

- Soft launch our service to a limited but wider audience than Alpha to gain feedback and understanding on how helpful our MVP is for our users 

Due to time constraints and business priorities, we had chosen for our MVP service to solve the business need of showcasing DfE programmes.  

As a service team, we however understood that a wider set of needs had to be addressed in order to encourage active career progression and practise development. 

We utilised Private Beta to capture further insights and expand our user journeys from Alpha. We understood that whilst we were focusing on the journey around users “Developing skills and experience” in Alpha, this journey was part of a wider non-linear and cyclical journey that included: 

- Starting you career in Child & family social work 

- Preparing for a job in Child & family social work 

- Developing skills and experience 

- Managing your career 

- Finding and applying for vacancies

![High Level As-Is User and Business Needs (Beta update)](high-level-as-is-user-and-business-needs.png "High Level As-Is User and Business Needs (Beta update)")

Based on user feedback during Private Beta, we knew we had to take a deeper dive into the journeys around “Managing your career” and meet user needs which would ultimately lead to users “Developing skills and experience”. 

Insights from user research and service feedback have been captured, our intention is to continue iterating these maps through every round of research
