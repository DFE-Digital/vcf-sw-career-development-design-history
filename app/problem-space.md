## Background 

The Department for Education wants to support Child & Family Social Workers to continuously improve their practice and encourage them to stay in Child & Family Social Care.

To improve social worker knowlege and skills, DfE fund a number of national development programmes for social workers at all stages of their career.

However:

- this approach alone did not improve practice and retention 
- third party providers and LAs primarily control the messaging about the programmes, providing fragmented and incomplete data to the DfE needed to effectively measure the value of the current offer and marketed the programmes at a high cost to the DfE


A borad discovery was conducted from July - Septemenr 2021 to better understand the child and family social work career development landscape and determine how the workforce strategy could be support by bringing user centred thinking. 

A single concept of a Career Guidance service was created focusing on the user pains:
- not understanding what career options are available
- not understanding what is required for a different role and how to evidence it, either because they still need to build the skills, or they have the skills but don’t know how to demonstrate them during application


In May 2022 the new team for an Alpha phase was formed to further explore the concept of a career guidance service for Social Workers with the following brief:

What are we trying to achieve?   
- We want to develop a one stop shop to support social workers continue improve their practice as they progress through their careers  
- This would enable social workers learn about social worker careers, pathways and opportunities.   
- This would enable social workers to learn about and sign up to our development programmes.   
- This would provide a home for other / future learning, such as the 5 year learning proposed by the Care Review [key for internal buy in] 
- This could create somewhere for DfE to communicate directly with social workers.  
- Longer term, this would create benefits to the business – e.g. better value for money, able to quickly respond to changes, able to be evidence driven (as own the data) 

We believe this would: 
- increase awareness of and engagement with our programmes.  Most social workers already complete ASYE although it isn’t compulsory but take up of our other programmes is low. 
- make it easier for social workers to understand their career options  
- reduce the burden of finding quality training and development.   
- enable social workers to be self-sufficient with career guidance, reducing reliance on managers and LAs.   
- create opportunities for DfE to deliver our programmes more efficiently.   
 
What does the thing we launch first look like? 
- National career guidance and links to local opportunities 
- Information about our development programmes – and signposts to them 
- The pre- and post-assessment parts of the accreditation user journey (possibly behind a log in) 
- Registration for the assessment service (developed by the assessment & accreditation strand) 
- Links to resources such as Social Work England and the PQS 
- Announcements and news relevant to the sector

## Understanding our users and their journeys

As a brand new Alpha team who had not been part of the previous discovery, there was a need to get up to speed as quickly as possible and set out our Research Plan for the Alpha phase.


Based on the discovery we held a workshop to re-map our understanding of the user journey, key pain points and opportunity areas. Adding in questions that we could not answer from reviewing the discovery documentation.

## Creating the Problem Statements

Following our user journey mapping we formulated our user problem statments through a framing exercise

As a team we noticed a discrepancy between the user problems and the solutions suggested by the business (DfE Policy Team). A workshop was held to better understand the business problems the DfE were trying to solve through the suggested ideas.

An updated set of problem statements were created to reflect the learnings from the workshops.
