## When
Sprint: Sprint 8
When: 02 January to 13 January 2023
(Sprint 7 was a Christmas period firebreak. No design was done in those weeks.)

## Overview / user needs
We iterated the core website based on the following:

### Issues identified during beta research round 5

- The purpose of website is unclear and users expect more than development programme content
- More clarification required whether ASYE is mandatory
- More information on the next steps when starting out as a practitioner
- Guidance on getting the best start after ASYE (Jim, see the writeup below - not sure how to word this)
- Improve your social work practice vs. what the page actually provides
- More content in the practitioner space required

See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nuaLKB23i-5jPldyuH8s8JuTd4SJc91JZzNEhjjTFgQ/edit?usp=share_link" target="_blank">beta round 5 user research findings report (opens in new tab)</a> for more detail.

### New and updated content

- Cookies page
- Privacy policy
- Error pages
- Upon aspiring/new programme pages

## Design thinking

### Programme content page iterations
JIM - something about content updates based on issues here?

### Purpose of website
Users have frequently feedback that the title of the service suggests a resource that contains more information that currently provided. They expect to find the following:
- different career paths across different areas of SW (including non-statutory)
- different types of roles, starting salaries and requisites
- standards and skills descriptions for roles
- approaches to career progression/ steps
- practical tools (e.g. direct tools) and advice to aid different responsibilities

These needs were also identified in the discovery phase. We have run design workshops and, subsequently, designed potential solutions during the alpha phase. These are out of scope for this phase of the project and form part of recommendations for future development of the service.

Something like that anyway!

## What happened next?
We'll test these changes in round 6 of user research.
