## When
Sprint: Sprint 8
When: 02 January to 13 January 2023
Posted by: Jim Laney / Jonathan Porton

Note: Sprint 7 was a Christmas period firebreak. No design was done in those weeks.

## Overview / user needs
We iterated the core website based on the following:

### Issues identified during beta research round 5

Users said:

- the purpose of the website is unclear
- they expect more than just development programme content
- it's not clear if ASYE is mandatory
- they wanted more information on the next steps when starting out as a practitioner
- they wanted more information on the next steps after completing ASYE
- the 'Improve your social work practice' content did not meet their expectations
- we need more content in the practitioner space

See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nuaLKB23i-5jPldyuH8s8JuTd4SJc91JZzNEhjjTFgQ/edit?usp=share_link" target="_blank">beta round 5 user research findings report (opens in new tab)</a> for more detail.

### New and updated content

- Cookies page
- Privacy policy
- Error pages
- Upon programme pages ('aspirant directors' and 'new directors')

## Design thinking

### Programme content page iterations
We have yet to iterate content based on round 5 user research findings.

### Purpose of the website
Users have said the title 'Develop your career in child and family social work' promises more than the service offers. They expect to see:
- different career paths across different areas of social work (including non-statutory)
- different types of roles, starting salaries and requisites
- standards and skills descriptions for roles
- approaches to career progression
- practical tools (for example, direct tools) and advice to aid different responsibilities

These needs were also identified in discovery. We ran design workshops and designed potential solutions during alpha. These are out of scope for private beta but form part of our recommendations for future development of the service.

## Next steps
We'll test these changes in round 6 of user research.
