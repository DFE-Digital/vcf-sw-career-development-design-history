## Updates

### Overview

We kicked off post-MVP work with a design sprint to determine how we'd tackle the next major iteration to the service: adding social worker roles and responsibilities.

We then did desk research, ideation and designed a prototype of a new page to allow social workers to explore roles in child and family social work.

The user stories for this phase of the project are:

- When aiming for a career goal, I need to understand the exact steps I can take towards it so that I can prepare for it in the most effective way

- When looking for the next step, I need to feel confident that the role I am moving into is right for me so that I can fully commit to preparing for the change and avoid disappointment

### Design thinking

Our initial design lists all the roles in the child and family social work sector. Roles sit under the same career stage headings as the homepage. Each role links to the National Career Service job profile for social workers so the user can read more about the role.

This page aims to show the typical roles and career stages in child and family social work. We also display a short summary of the career stage and role, average salary and typical hours.

As this is a signposting page, we had to consider how we'll let the user know they'll be redirected to the external National Career Service site. To prevent accessibility issues around opening links in a new tab or window, we decided that the design will use external links that open a new website rather than a tab. The links include the words ‘opens a new website’ to make the user aware they will be navigating away from the service.

We added a call to action to the homepage directing the user to the explore roles page. We also added links to the sub-level navigation pages.

### Next steps

- Write content for the explore roles page to replace placeholder text. The design of this page may change based on the content.

- This page will also need to be user tested. Accessibility and usability issues may arise from navigating the user away from the service.
