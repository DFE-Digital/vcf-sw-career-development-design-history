## When
Sprint: Sprint 6
When: 5 December to 16 December 2022

## Overview / user needs
We created an alternate version of the core website.

### Why?
As mentioned in previous posts. The choice of language to describe the career stages was not always understood or recognised by users. This issue has been identified in every round of user research to date. As such, we felt it would be remiss to not test an alternate version.

## Design thinking
As detailed in <a href="/beta-phase/core-website-v4/#creating-a-taxonomy">our post detailing version 4 of the core website (the first version designed in beta)</a> we identified a number of possible taxonomies for the website.

In preparation for the creation of the alternative version, the UCD reviewed the possible taxonomies. We challenged these against any user research findings that had been identified since creation and decided upon the following taxonomy:

<a href="taxonomy-alternative-v1.png" target="_blank">![Development programme alternative taxonomy](taxonomy-alternative-v1.png "Development programme alternative taxonomy")</a>

We recreated the entire service from homepage down to programme pages to demonstrate the new structure. This gave us flexibility to adapt content on any page to support the new language.

### Content considerations
It was important to ensure the user journey onto the partner websites remained cohesive. We used the partner and DfE language within the card descriptions to aid the user in recognising these terms later when they reached the partner websites.

## What happened next?

This alternate structure was testing in round 5. COME BACK AND FILL IN WHAT HAPPENED HERE.
