## When
Sprint: Sprint 2
When: 10 to 24 October 2022

## Overview
We needed to change the service name used in alpha – 'Social worker career development' – to something meaningful and descriptive.

## What we did
The team held a workshop to try and come up with a name for the service.

First, we talked through <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service">GDS guidelines around naming services</a>.

We then invited team members on to an online whiteboard and spent 10 minutes coming up with as many names as possible.

After that, we took 20 minutes to discuss the options and eliminated anything that:

- did not start with a verb
- was not descriptive
- was not self-explanatory

Once we were down to 5 post-its, everyone dot-voted for their favourite option.

The winning name, voted for by all but one team member, was 'Develop your career in child and family social work'.

## What next

We'll check how the name performs in user testing in the coming weeks.

We'll also need to think about a domain name system (DNS), for example social-worker-career-development.education.gov.uk.
