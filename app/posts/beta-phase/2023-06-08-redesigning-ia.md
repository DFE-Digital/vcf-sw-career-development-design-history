## Overview

Our current post-MVP prototype has a basic navigation system focused on navigating DFE-funded development programs and roles by career stages. As we plan to add more features to the post-MVP, we felt it was the right time to update our information architecture (IA) with a new navigation system. 

 

We aim to: 

- create a new sitemap that lets us seamlessly incorporate new functionality without constantly redesigning the site structure and navigation 

- organise the IA in a way that remains easy to navigate for users as we expand our content 

 

IA workshop 

To kickstart this process, we held a collaborative workshop involving all our team’s disciplines. The workshop included: 

- an overview of the latest user research findings 

- a hierarchy activity 

- a team sitemapping exercise

## Goals and objectives for the IA workshop 

- Use insights from user research to guide our ideation for content organisation and sitemap creation. This approach helped us create a starting point to develop a future state sitemap that meets our users’ needs. 

- Work together to identify potential features for the future state of our service. 

- Understand the hierarchy of the potential features we've identified. Through discussions and mapping exercises, we gained a better understanding of how these features fit into our service and how to prioritise them. 

 

## Outcomes 

- We realised there might not be a clear hierarchy among the new features. However, it became clear we would need to add a primary and secondary navigation to accommodate all the new features. User research findings, including a card sort exercise, also reflected the lack of inherent hierarchy between elements. Some elements were seen as related to multiple groups, potentially serving as a bridge or link between them. 

- We recognised that user journeys differ for child and family social workers already in their career versus those starting out. We incorporated this consideration into the new sitemap to ensure easy access to information in separate spaces, addressing these distinct user journeys. 

- We agreed that having some information accessible by career stage would still be useful for certain users. We also acknowledged the need for some content to be repeated in the form of overviews and detailed sections to provide comprehensive insights, such as roles for specific career stages being available both on dedicated career stage areas and a general page for exploring roles. This allows the user to see roles in a personalised view as well as overall, giving them an understanding of career progression. 

- We were mindful to not accidentally hide content due to the new organisational structure, ensuring that all content remains easily accessible.  

- With a clear understanding of our new features our team conducted a collaborative t-shirt estimation session that involved product, technical, and design aspects. 

 

## Our updated IA 

Following the workshop, we designed the post-MVP sitemap and taxonomy. While a clear hierarchy was not evident, we identified the main navigation areas as: 

- About child and family social work 

- Career stage information hub 

- Development programs 

- Roles in child and family social work 

- Practice development resources 

- News 

- Community

## Next steps 

The design team will begin incorporating the newly designed IA into the prototype. Following the roadmap, we will gradually add the additional features. To ensure the IA organisation is user-friendly and coherent, we will conduct user testing in the upcoming round 4 research sessions.
