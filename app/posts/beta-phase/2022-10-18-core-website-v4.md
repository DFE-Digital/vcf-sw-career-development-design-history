## When
Sprint: Sprints 1 and 2
When: 26 September to 24 October 2022

## Overview / user needs
We iterated the core website. This iteration was based on the following:
### User needs identified during the alpha research sessions
- The homepage should offer alternate routes into development programmes. No users interpreted programmes as a means to progress their careers. Make it clear what programmes are relevant and to whom.
- Ensure content clearly explains positioning. The DfE is associated with school education and the lack of clarifying content misled some users into thinking the service is focused on social work at schools or within the DfE. Also make it clear the focus is child and family work social work.
- based on subject area (to find what they’re most interested in)
- based on role/years in practice (to ensure the right level for them)
- to ensure eligibility (to not “waste time reading it”)

### New and revised development programme content
The team did new content audits of the partner's websites so we could better understand the subject matter.
<!-- Additionally, the previous audit had been conducted by a team member who had subsequently left. -->
For each programme, we wanted to know:

- the commitment required by social workers
- the goals and benefits (for example, impact on career progression)
- the curriculum and format of training
- tips on how to manage programme commitments with caseloads
- how delivery (especially of ASYE) can differ across local authorities
- next steps after completion
- what people who'd completed it thought

We factored the findings into our design thinking for this iteration.

> Based on the audit, we agreed to focus on creating content for the Pathways programme, starting with Pathways 1 and 2.

## Design thinking

### Creating a taxonomy
The first step was to identify local groupings for the programmes.

The team met with policy colleagues and reviewed a number of options for the physical groupings and titles of these groupings.

The default (prototype) groupings were based on a combination of DfE terminology (for example, practice leader) and terminology used in the Frontline Pathways programme content such as middle manager.

The next step was to decide where programmes should sit under the groups. Pathways was designed so that in-role and aspirant candidates can attend as a cohort. Therefore, we needed to reference the same pathway across several groups. The final taxonomy was agreed:

<a href="taxonomy-v01.png" target="_blank">![Development programme taxonomy](taxonomy-v01.png "Development programme taxonomy")</a>

Depending on the grouping and number of programmes under that grouping, users would then reach the programme content pages in a couple of different ways:
1. If there was only one development programme associated with the grouping then, upon clicking the grouping link, users would then be taken directly to the programme content page:

<a href="prototype-programme-pathway-1-v1.png" target="_blank">![Pathway 1 content page](prototype-programme-pathway-1-v1.png "Pathway 1 content page")</a>

2. If multiple development programmes were associated with the grouping then, upon clicking the grouping link, users would then be taken to a sub-level navigation page, where further card components would allow them to choose the programme relevant to them:

<a href="prototype-sub-level-practice-supervisors-v1.png" target="_blank">![Sub-level navigation page](prototype-sub-level-practice-supervisors-v1.png "Sub-level navigation page")</a>

### Writing Pathways 1 and 2 content

We used the [Frontline website](https://thefrontline.org.uk/pathways-programme/pathways-programme-apply/) as source material for the Pathways 1 and 2 pages.

We included a summary section at the top of each page to show the key facts for each programme. This had tested well in alpha.

There are multiple different job titles for the same or similar role in social work, so we included alternatives to 'practice supervisor' and 'middle manager' in the summary to help users know if they're in the right place.

We included what we think are the important details for each pathway, including:

- who it’s for
- what it offers
- how it’s delivered
- how it’s funded
- how to apply

We've tried to summarise the information on the Frontline website and avoid duplication.

## What happened next?

The final version was then tested with 6 participants in the round 1 research sessions.

We also decided to create an alternate version, using the development programme titles as the groups. We did this in alpha but never tested with real content below the titles. This was not tested during round 1.

## What needs to happen now?
Review R1 findings. Make tweaks and retest. Add Pathway 3 content etc.
