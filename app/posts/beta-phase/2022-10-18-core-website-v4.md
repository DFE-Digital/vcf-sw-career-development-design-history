## When
Sprint: Sprint 1 and 2
When: 26 September - 24 October 2022

## Overview / user needs
We iterated the core website. This iteration was based on the following:
### User needs identified during the alpha research sessions
- The HP should reflect alternate routes into development programmes. No users interpreted programmes as a means to progress career. Make it clear what programmes are relevant and to whom.
- Ensure content clearly explains positioning. The DfE is associated with school education and the lack of clarifying content mislead some users into thinking the service is focused on Social Work at schools or within DfE. Also make it clear the focus is Children and Family SW - not adult.
- based on subject area (to find what they’re most interested in)
- based on role/years in practice (to ensure the right level for them)
- to ensure eligibility (to not “waste time reading it”)

### New and revised development programme content
The team conducted new content audits on all the DfE development programme partner websites. We did this to ensure a better understanding of the subject material. Additionally, the previous audit had been conducted by a team member who had subsequently left. The audit was designed to identify content for the following areas:

- Information on the commitment required by Social Workers for DfE development programmes
- Information on the programme's goals and benefits. e.g. Impact on career progression
- Information on curriculum and format of training
- Tips on how to manage programme commitments with caseloads
- How the delivery of the programme (especially ASYE) can differ across LAs
- Next steps after completing programmes
- Any testimonials from individuals who have completed the programmes

Findings from the audit were factored into our design thinking for this iteration.

> Based on the audit, we agreed to focus on creating content for the Pathways programme - starting with Pathways 1 and 2.

## Design thinking

### Creating a development programme taxonomy
The first step was to identify local groupings for the programmes. The team met with policy stakeholders and reviewed a number of options for the physical groupings and titles of these groupings. The default (prototype) groupings were based on a combination of DfE terminology (e.g. practice leaders) and terminology used in the Frontline Pathways programme content such as 'middle-managers'.

The next step was to decide where the development programmes should sit under the groups. The Pathways programme was created in such a way that in-role and aspirant candidates could attend as a cohort. Therefore, we needed to reference the same pathway across several groups. The final taxonomy was agreed:

<a href="taxonomy-v01.png" target="_blank">![Development programme taxonomy](taxonomy-v01.png "Development programme taxonomy")</a>

Depending on the grouping and number of programmes under that grouping, users would then reach the programme content pages in a couple of different ways:
1. If there was only one development programme associated with the grouping then, upon clicking the grouping link, users would then be taken directly to the programme content page:

<a href="prototype-programme-pathway-1-v1.png" target="_blank">![Pathway 1 content page](prototype-programme-pathway-1-v1.png "Pathway 1 content page")</a>

2. If multiple development programmes were associated with the grouping then, upon clicking the grouping link, users would then be taken to a sub-level navigation page, where further card components would allow them to choose the programme relevant to them:

<a href="prototype-sub-level-practice-supervisors-v1.png" target="_blank">![Sub-level navigation page](prototype-sub-level-practice-supervisors-v1.png "Sub-level navigation page")</a>

### Writing Pathways 1 and 2 content

Jim wrote some content.

## What happened next?

The final version was then tested with 6 participants in the round 1 research sessions.

We also decided to create an alternate version, using the development programme titles as the groups. We did this in alpha but never tested with real content below the titles. This was not tested during round 1.

## What needs to happen now?
Review R1 findings. Make tweaks and retest. Add Pathway 3 content etc.
