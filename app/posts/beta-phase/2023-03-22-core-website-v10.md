## Content changes

<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y1isfjQF4gG8r2ln_qRDbVMfA9auyrzeGsoLwheDGpQ/edit#slide=id.g1fb296a8bfc_0_59">Round 6 of user research</a> revealed that some of the content on the upon: aspirant directors and upon: new directors pages was unclear and unhelpful.

We sought clarity from The Staff College (one of the providers of the programmes) to help us improve it.

First, we had call with team members and Staff College respresentatives where we walked through the prototype and shared user feedback we'd received. We then sent them a list of questions to get more detail on the programmes and fill content gaps.

We used <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1POOEpZgG53Pwz6v-8lCod32wNSfVn8ib/edit">their feedback</a> to update and improve the content on these pages.

#### upon: aspirant directors

Content changes included:

- removing strategic and princial social workers from the summary
- adding tiers in the 'Who it's for' section
- adding that there are residentials and how long they last
- adding more detail around optional accreditation
- expanding on 'learning visits', 'action learning' and 'leadership challenge activities'
- changing 'Upon' to 'upon'

#### upon: new directors

Content changes included:

- updating the summary and 'How it's delivered' section to say there is no mandatory time commitment
- editing the 'What you'll learn' section to better reflect the programme's benefits
- adding more detail around content and components to the 'How it's delivered' section

Changed order of sections (how it's delivered and what you'll get)?
Changed Improve your SW practice to Develop you SW practice
Saying which programmes are for statutory SWs
