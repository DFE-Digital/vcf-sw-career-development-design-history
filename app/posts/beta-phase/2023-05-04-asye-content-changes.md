## Overview

In <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y1isfjQF4gG8r2ln_qRDbVMfA9auyrzeGsoLwheDGpQ/edit#slide=id.g1fb296a8bfc_0_59">round 5 of user research</a> we tested the content on the <a href="https://vcf-sw-career-dev-prototype.herokuapp.com/current/roles/asye">assessed and supported year in employment (ASYE) page</a> for newly qualified social workers (NQSWs).

Some of the questions we came away from testing with included:

- how should we describe Skills for Care's involvement with the ASYE?
- is the ASYE compulsory?
- does the ASYE lasts for 12 months or 24 months?
- what do placements involve?
- can non-statutory NQSWs do the ASYE?

We met with a subject matter expert from the charity Skills for Care (who helped to develop the ASYE) to get their input.

## Feedback

<a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com.mcas.ms/:w:/r/sites/Vulnerablechildrenandfamiliesportfolio/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE4E3BA70-6EA2-5510-BDA0-399114B5D377%7D&file=ASYE%20v4.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&cid=0f67063b-a865-4f81-b756-792d3f896cfc">Skills for Care confirmed</a> that the ASYE:

- is delivered by the NQSW's employer "via a national programme provided by Skills for Care"
- is not mandatory but it is "an industry standard" and NQSWs are encouraged to do it
- runs for 12 months unless the NQSW works part-time or defers
- does not include the opportunity to go on placements
- is for both statutory and non-statutory NQSWs

They also recommended we:

- mention the individual learning agreement that NQSWs complete at the start of their ASYE
- signpost to the Skills for Care website for information on ASYE stages
- outline the benefits of the ASYE
- switch the order of sections so that 'How you're supported' comes before 'How you're assessed'

## Content changes

Using Skills for Care's input we:

- updated the key facts section to say that the ASYE is delivered by the NQSW's employer based on a national framework provided by Skills for Career
- removed the reference to most employers requiring that NQSWs do the ASYE and instead say it's recommended
- added that the ASYE can be extended beyond 12 months if the NQSW works part-time or takes leave
- removed the reference to placements
- added that the ASYE is open to both statutory and non-statutory NQSWs
- included information about the personal development plan
- added a link to the Skills for Care page on the stages of the ASYE
- added a section talking about the benefits of the ASYE
- moved the 'How you're supported' section above 'How you're assessed'
