## When
When: Beta phase

## Overview
This post details the design components we use on the service, including:

- what components we use
- why we use them
- where they came from
- our design thinking
- what we found out in research sessions about them

## Design components

### DfE header
Service name length, mobile adjustments, future plans, feedback in research - looks like gov. Some users not clicking on the link

### full-width banner
Where it came from. Why this vs. fixed 960 width one. Any findings such as scroll length. I.e. could we reduce the height?

### Card component
Where it came from. Choice of many. Adaptation to improve it such as fixed height vs. neighbour - esp for iPad issue. Show how it looked before vs. after. Wrap under each other in smaller viewport. The need for non-background version. Possibly make product cards in future
We also use it on sub-level nav pages. Some concerns when used with non-shaded card under HR

### Contextual breadcrumbs
Our decisions on these dependent on route taken (stages vs. all progs),

### Contextual sidebar
Why we chose it given it's a gov thing. Other DfE services that use it. What we found - show the versions

### Summary list
Why we use it. What we found
