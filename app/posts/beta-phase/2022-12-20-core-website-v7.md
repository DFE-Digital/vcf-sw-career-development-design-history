## When
Sprint: Sprint 6
When: 5 December to 16 December 2022
Posted by: Jim Laney and Jonathan Porton

## Overview / user needs

### Issues identified during beta research round 4

On the Pathway 3 content page, users:
  - highlighted issues with some of the content in the 'Who it's for' section
  - did not understand some language taken from the Frontline website, for example 'Frontline Fellowship', 'experiential visit' and 'shadowing days'
  - wanted more clarity around time commitment and what 'online learning' entailed

Some users also struggled to use the Frontline website after navigating there from our site.

See the <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/Vulnerablechildrenandfamiliesportfolio/Shared%20Documents/Childrens%20social%20care/9.%20Career%20Progression%20(August%202021%20-%20)/10%20Beta/2.%20UCD/User%20Research/4.%20Outputs/Round%204/SWCD%20Beta%20Round%204%20UR%20Findings.pptx?d=wee071128125d5552f886a8bc035a74d4&csf=1&web=1&e=ZtKCxb">beta round 4 user research findings report</a> for more detail.

### New and updated content

- ASYE programme page
- Alternate navigation (all pages)
- Pathway 4
- Homepage
- Sub-level navigation pages

## Design thinking

### Programme content page iterations
We iterated Pathways pages by:

- replacing 'Frontline Fellowship' with 'Frontline's network of leaders'
- removing 'experiential visit' and describing what it means in plain English
- removing 'shadowing day' and describing what it means in plain English

We sought clarity from Frontline on some of the other content issues raised during research. We've been told we can expect a response no later than Monday 30 January. We can then iterate further based on their feedback.

### Frontline website feedback
We fed back the research findings to the Frontline team, including how some users:
- got lost in the top level navigation
- missed the briefing sessions link
- signed up to the wrong programme

### Design of supporting pages
During this sprint we designed the <a href="https://vcf-sw-career-dev-prototype.herokuapp.com/supporting-pages/list-of-pages">supporting pages</a> for the service, including:
- cookies page
- cookies banner functionality
- accessibility statement
- terms and conditions
- page not found
- there is a problem with the service
- service unavailable

We also designed the header and footer elements as they should appear on live. These were designed to be a point of truth for the development team, without any of the prototype kit specific links (such as 'clear data').

The cookies banner functionality was designed to simulate exactly how this should work. JP to finish this once cookies works again!

## Next steps
We'll test these changes in round 5 of user research, along with the alternate navigation structure.
