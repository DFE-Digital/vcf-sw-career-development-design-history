## When
Sprint: Sprint 6
When: 05 December to 16 December 2022

## Overview / user needs
We iterated the core website based on the following:

### Issues identified during beta research round 4

- Pathway 3 content page
  - Pens of power research activity on pathway 3 content highlighted issues with some of the 'who it's for' section
  - Some language from the Frontline website was not understood, e.g. 'The Frontline Fellowship...'
  - Users wanted more clarity around the time commitment and what the 'online learning' entailed
- Some issues were identified with the Frontline website itself

See the See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18i8lvGJL9-YLO5xgmtbZ-Nn1r2Yz23cYGSFbW6VjVeY/edit?usp=share_link" target="_blank">beta round 4 user research findings report (opens in new tab)</a> for more detail.

### New and updated content

- ASYE programme page
- Alternate navigation - all pages
- Pathway 4
- Homepage
- Sub-level navigation pages

## Design thinking

### Programme content page iterations
JIM - something about content updates based on issues here?

### Frontline website feedback
We fed back the research findings to the Frontline team, including:
- users getting lost in the top level navigation
- missing the briefing sessions link
- signing up to the wrong programme

### Design of supporting pages
During this sprint we designed the <a href="https://vcf-sw-career-dev-prototype.herokuapp.com/supporting-pages/list-of-pages" target="_blank">supporting pages (opens in new tab)</a> for the service. These included:
- cookies page
- cookies banner functionality
- accessibility statement
- terms and conditions
- page not found
- there is a problem with the service
- service unavailable

We also designed the header and footer elements as they should appear on live. These were designed to be a point of truth for the development team, without any of the prototype kit specific links (such as 'clear data').

The cookies banner functionality was designed to simulate exactly how this should work. JP to finish this once cookies works again!

## What happened next?
We'll test these changes in round 5 of user research, along with the alternate navigation structure.
