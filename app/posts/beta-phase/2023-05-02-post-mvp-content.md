## When
Sprint: Sprint 15
When: 10 to 21 April 2023
Posted by: Jim Laney

## Overview

Following on from <a href="https://vcf-sw-career-dev-des-history.herokuapp.com/beta-phase/post-mvp-design/">post-MVP design work in sprints 12 and 13</a> we needed to design content for social worker roles and responsibilities.

This involved:

- updating the homepage to reflect this new theme
- adding a section showing relevant roles on sub-level navigation pages
- adding job descriptions and salary ranges for each role on the new 'explore roles' page

## Homepage

We updated the lead paragraph and the H2 on the homepage to show that the site includes information about social worker roles as well as development programmes.

We also updated the placeholder content in the ‘View all programmes’ and ‘View all roles’ card components.

## Sub-level navigation pages

H1s were changed from 'Programmes for (career stage)' to the career stage itself, for example 'Managers'.

H2s were added: 'Development programmes' and 'Roles' (and 'Professional development' for the practitioner career stage).

Relevant roles and job descriptions were added.

## Roles page

Members of the team <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com.mcas.ms/:x:/r/sites/Vulnerablechildrenandfamiliesportfolio/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B831E49B2-FFB5-5C2A-3C8F-BDD5C9E37156%7D&file=C%26F%20Roles.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1">researched job ads</a> and <a href="https://lucid.app/lucidspark/8dc34fa1-6088-44b9-8a06-601f5af465cc/edit?page=0_0#">mapped their findings</a>.

We used this information to create a first iteration of the <a href="https://vcf-sw-career-dev-prototype.herokuapp.com/current/roles/explore-roles?sending-page=home">Roles in child and family social work</a> page, listing job titles with brief descriptions and average salaries.

We removed the typical hours component as they were largely the same for each role based on our research.

## Next steps

Test content with users.
