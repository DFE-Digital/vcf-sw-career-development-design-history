## When
Sprint: Sprint 0
When: 19 to 23 September 2022
Posted by: Jonathan Porton

## Overview
The first logical step was to determine whether to split the alpha and beta prototypes. It was decided to use the same Github repo and Heroku app. The first version of the prototype in beta would be an iteration of the core prototype in alpha.

Any radical changes would be handled via branches as required. An additional choice was to avoid creating unnecessary apps in the DfE Heroku account. Especially in light of the decision by Heroku to remove free accounts.

## Where we started
Towards the end of alpha a <a href="https://design.education.gov.uk/branding.html" target="_blank">new Design in DfE manual</a> was shared. This detailed design rules for services that would be hosted on the .education account - which we feel is where our service will likely live.

We began by implementing the header as outlined in the manual. We replaced the gov blue with the DfE accent blue for other elements.

The alpha work was also archived under a new section on the prototype landing page and a capture of the prototype before the DfE branding was created.

## Design thinking
The UCD team was determined to be more collaborative in beta. This meant content design working directly with the prototype. Additionally, to create a simple resource for design and dev, we used the DfE Figma account.

Using Figma would provide a number of benefits:

- A place to create lots of concepts simply
- A central hub for brand colours
- Using FigJam to create taxonomy and sitemap examples and directly tie into Figma designs and live prototype pages
- A library of flow components created during alpha (which could easily be exported into Lucid if required)

## Design tasks completed
The following design tasks where completed:

- Continued use of DfE repo and Heroku app:
  - <a href="https://github.com/DFE-Digital/vcf-sw-career-development-prototype" target="_blank">Github repository (opens in new tab)</a>
  - <a href="https://vcf-sw-career-dev-prototype.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Heroku app (opens in new tab)</a>
- New DfE header added to prototype, along with tweaks to components based on DfE accent colour
- Further investigation of other DfE service examples which have been added to the existing Lucid Board:
  - <a href="https://lucid.app/lucidspark/aec2b364-6144-4839-ac02-c0f7b3dfaea3/edit?invitationId=inv_d0449cb7-b37a-4fac-94cb-e86ff3ed7c55#" target="_blank">DfE service examples PDF (opens in new tab)</a>
- Setup of a <a href="https://www.figma.com/files/project/57825408/VCF---Social-worker-career-development?fuid=1111661131405226767" target="_blank"> project</a> in the DfE Figma account

## What happened next?

The UCD team started planning an iteration of the core website which will be tested in round 1 of the user research.
