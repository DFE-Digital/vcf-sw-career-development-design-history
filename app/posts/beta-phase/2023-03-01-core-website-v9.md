## When
Sprint: Sprints 9 and 10
When: 16 January to 10 February 2023
Posted by: Jim Laney

### Issues from rounds 6 and 7 of user testing

Users said:

- they thought the Pathways programmes were only accessible if you'd "come into social work through Frontline" (the provider of Pathways)
- they did not realise they had to be employed by a local authority to do the Pathways programmes
- specialist roles should have their own section on the homepage (for example, practice education, child protection advisor and independent reviewing officer)
- the role of principal social worker should be in the senior managers category on the homepage, not leaders
- they do not understand what a strategic social worker is
- they missed the 'View all programmes link' on the homepage
- they'd like to be able filter by career stage or have a search function

See <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y1isfjQF4gG8r2ln_qRDbVMfA9auyrzeGsoLwheDGpQ/edit?usp=share_link">round 6</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YUnIySPhKPza549ZNGi7KFhI-HxOM1Mx7eD3jT8zJUU/edit#slide=id.g208e2b51ce9_0_225">round 7</a> user research findings for more detail.

## Design iterations

### Moving to the 'alternate' homepage design
We switched to the version of the homepage which uses the career stage groupings:

- practitioners
- experienced practitioners
- managers
- senior managers
- leaders

The team believed this was the preferable structure, but <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MS_DKBX12P0eSNb3Rjm9RJH5HsSs9KKh/edit#">feedback from Frontline</a> (the provider of the Pathways programmes) and user testing helped confirm it.

After seeing the original homepage, Frontline said:

>"The landing page on the website is confusing for heads of service – we would count them as senior leaders not middle managers – so we would recommend moving Heads of Service and Service Managers into the Senior Leader section alongside Practice Leaders (or even having them completely separate) and leaving Middle Managers as IROs, Team Manager, Team leader."

We also got feedback on the alternate homepage from user research participants who said:

- the career stage titles align with the language they use
- the groupings reflect users’ actual experience of roles and responsibilities within each career stage

### Content changes

We used <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MS_DKBX12P0eSNb3Rjm9RJH5HsSs9KKh/edit#">feedback from Frontline</a> to iterate Pathways content, including:

- adding new job titles to the key facts section for Pathways 2 and 3
- updating the 'What you'll learn' section for all Pathways pages
- adding more detail in the 'How it's delivered' section for all Pathways pages
- moving 'principal social workers' to the 'Senior managers' card on the homepage
