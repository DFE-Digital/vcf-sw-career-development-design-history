<strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--purple">Career progression</strong>

## When
Sprint: Sprint 1
When: 10 June 2022 - 17 June 2022

## Overview / user needs
One of the key findings from discovery was that social workers struggle to know what their career options are and how to progress in their careers. Whilst we cannot solve the problem of limited career progression routes with this service, we did feel we could help them to better understand what options were available and/or provide resources to support their progression.

> **Discovery report**: Career journeys are varied and complicated, with variation between structures in LAs. Users struggle to understand whatâ€™s on offer and how to progress.

## Design thinking
We decided to design a tool that users could use to help them better understand the options available to them. The tool was based around the standard .gov question and recommendation patterns. Users would answer a series of questions and get a set of recommendations at the end. Possible question areas include:

- The users current role
- Their level of experience
- Additional skills and/or experience
- Aspirations and goals

Recommendations might be:

- Suitable upwards career options
- Possible sideways career options into similar roles elsewhere
- Relevant training to prepare them for progression
- Guidance around evidencing skills and knowledge
- Improving and growing in their current role
- Providing a blueprint for progression (which could be downloaded for personal reference and/or shared with manager)

Based on their answers, they could browse guidance and advice on their career options now. Additionally, ideas and pathways for further career goals. For this concept, we chose not to show answer at each step. Why? At this stage the journey would be completely linear, so the user would need to see the recommendation page before deciding whether to go back and change their answers.

NB: Content was not provided for this concept and placeholder text was used.

## What happened next?
The concept **was not** shown to, or tested with users. Subsequent research shows that the tool could provide more than the suggested. For instance, help users improve in their mental well-being.
