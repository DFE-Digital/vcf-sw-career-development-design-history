## When
Sprint: Sprint 2
When: 27 June 2022 - 2 July 2022

## Overview / user needs
During sprint 1, we designed a tool for searching and filtering by CPDs. As detailed in that post, an opportunity was identified to centralise CPD offerings.

For this concept, we wanted to present the same functionality in a different way. We chose to make it more aligned to the career tool as felt both tools might ultimately become one - returning relevant DfE programmes as a suggestion alongside other guidance and help.

We took three additional decisions with this concept:

1. We limited the results to just DfE development programme offerings.
2. We kept the term CPD despite DfE not using that term with the programmes. We felt 'CPD' was a term more widely used in social work circles than, say, 'development programmes'.
3. We kept this tool and the careers tool distinctly separate at this stage. We wanted to understand if users saw CPD / training as a necessary step to career progression or separately[^1]

## Design thinking
Given we felt this tool might be integrated with the career tool, it was presented as a question and recommendation pattern. For this concept, we showed a summary of previous answers after each question. Why? It was felt that this tool might not be linear and, dependent on answers, users might reach the recommendation page earlier. A final check answers page was also included but is probably not necessary.

The results page was designed to return relevant results as cards. This was influenced by an existing pattern on the <a href="https://find-dfe-approved-framework.service.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Find a framework for you school DfE service.</a>

NB: Content was not provided for this concept and placeholder text was used.

## What happened next?
The concept **was not** shown to, or tested with users.

[^1]: Discovery report: Social workers engage with CPD if they perceive benefits for families or their own practice & progression. Completing CPD is not the only important factor in career progression.
