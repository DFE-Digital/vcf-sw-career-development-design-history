## When
Sprint: Sprint 5
When: 12 July 2022 - 16 July 2022

## Background

### Facts

- UPON is not really touched upon (!) in discovery
- It is a DfE programme but it is delivered by partners from the private sector
- It has two sub-programmes –
  - The Aspirant Directors Programme
  - New Directors Programme (why does the first one have a definite article but not the second? So weird)

Issues and concerns

- What is the official name of the programme? Is it UPON Future Leaders Programme? Is UPON an acronym, if so, what for? Is ‘Inspiring Leaders’ a slogan or part of the programme title? Is it all lower case, as on the website, or upper case, as in the logo? There is no consistency of presentation.
- The website <a href="https://uponleaders.co.uk/" target="_blank">(https://uponleaders.co.uk/) is all very whizzy, but it’s full of woolly marketing speak and a fair few typos (We passionately oer the same level of support)
- UPON actually means nothing to users – they will sign up to either The Aspirant Directors Programme or New Directors Programme, not UPON. UPON is the name of a DfE programme and as such should really only be used internally. The fact that they built a website for it kind of boggles me – it’s really bad comms practice.
- The fact that neither of the programme names actually specify that they are for directors of children’s services is a big problem for findability
- The Apply now button on the Upon homepages takes you to a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WEBSITE, which only deals with the Aspirant Directors Programme, is a maze of badly considered and designed pages that, after many clicks, eventually tell you applications are closed. It really is a very, very bad website!=

## Content considerations

### User needs
It is unclear what the over-arching user needs for Directors are, because the term Directors was not used by the discovery team – another example of the problems inherent in providing a national website for a field in which terminology is not standardised across LAs.
Directors or aspirants will not be visiting our site to complete a form or task, neither will they be seeking guidance on how to complete a task – any content of that sort is going to be on the main UPON website. (In fact

I would suggest that the user needs for the Aspirant Directors Programme content should be

- **As a** social worker who wants to become a director
**I need** to know what the Aspirant Directors programme entails
**so that** I can decide if it is right for me


- **As a** social worker who wants to apply for the ADP
**I need** to know how to apply for the training programme
**so that** I can submit my application

I would suggest that the user needs for The New Directors Programme content should be

- **As a** new Director of childrens services
**I need** to know what would be expected of me during The New Directors Programme
**so that** I can prepare myself

### Proposed approach

Since this is information not guidance, I think the best way to think about the content itself is to identify the questions it needs to answer for users. I think these are

- **What** is the course?  Description in general term.
- **Who** should take an ASYE?
- **Why** should I be glad to do it rather than rolling my eyes at it?
- **How** is the course delivered – examinations, course work, assessment, supervision...? What’s the workload, and will it interfere with my actual job?
- **How** is success or failure measured and evaluated?

The content needs to be short, to the point, plain English, jargon free and, ideally, reassuring.
