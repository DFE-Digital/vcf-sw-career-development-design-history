## Background

### Facts from discovery

- The ASYE is for newly qualified social workers (NQSWs)
- Discovery is unclear whether it is compulsory in all LAs, but in at least some NQSWs are automatically enrolled
- Most NQSWs see ASYE as a support programme to ease them into social work, not part of their career progression

### Issues with the ASYE itself

- LAs like ASYE, but only 65% of NQSWs found it useful
  - NQSWs who trained by doing a degree normally found it useful
  - NQSWs who qualified through Step Up to Social Work or Frontline felt it was repetitive and unproductive
- Some LAs have extended ASYE into an unofficial second year, which can cause confusion between the official and unofficial ASYE and risks reputational damage
- Although there is a <a href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/resources/documents/Regulated-professions/Social-work/ASYE/Evaluation-criteria-for-the-ASYE.pdf" target="_blank">national framework outlining evaluation criteria</a>, it is not overseen and enforced, and the course and its assessment is delivered by LAs – self-regulation inevitably leads to inconsistency
- Funding is managed by LAs, which could lead to some deprioritising it, or make it vulnerable to cuts

### Resources

These are primarily aimed at managers and supervisors.

### Issues and concerns

- We have been tasked with producing content that is nationally relevant, but with so little consistency between LAs in terms of terminology, duration, implementation, assessment, funding, and the requirement to even participate, the content runs the risk of being either too specific to be of use to everyone, or too generalised to be of use to anyone. Finding the sweet spot between these two extremes is going to be **extremely difficult indeed**.
- We have been tasked with producing content for NQSWs, but all the raw material we have been provided with so far is aimed at managers and supervisors. This means that, at least in Alpha, the drafts produced will require a lot of guesswork on the part of the content designer. This will place an unusual strain on the UR team to validate and/or critique the content. The UR team’s task will be made doubly difficult by the widely different experiences and needs of NQSWs from different LAs.
- Naming conventions / taxonomy. There is an ASYE for adult services also, so we will need to be mindful in our titles and metadata to specify that we are referring to the ASYE for child and family services. This could make referring to it very long-winded over the course of a page if we’re not careful and precise.

## Content considerations

### User needs

Two overarching NQSW user needs were identified in discovery

- As a NQSW
I need to be aware of what my career options are
so that I know what to aim for

- As a NQSW
I need extra support during the early years of my career
so that I can adjust to the job gradually

However, I would argue that these are not really relevant to the ASYE content we are tasked to provide.

NQSWs will not be visiting our site to complete a form or task, neither will they be seeking guidance on how to complete a task – any content of that sort is going to be on their LA website or intranet.  So our content is primarily informational and must not be LA-specific.

Because all the guidance and transactional content relevant to NQSWs doing their ASYE is going to be provided by their LA, **I would argue that the majority of our users will not be NQSWs** but will instead be

- considering a career in child and family social work
- in training but not yet working at a specific LA
- nearing the end of training and looking for information on what happens next

To that end I would suggest that the user needs for our ASYE content should be:

- **As a** person who wants to be a social worker
**I need** to know what to expect from my ASYE
**so that** I can be psychologically and practically prepared

- **As a** person who wants to be a social worker
**I need** to know what would be expected of me during my ASYE
**so that** I can give myself the best chance of meeting those expectations

Addressing these user needs will still address one of our core goals - reducing staff turnover - by helping prospective social workers set realistic expectations based on accurate information about what they are letting themselves in for.

Although our task is to build a website for social workers, I think we would do well to consider that the age of our audience may be lower than we initially thought – 6th formers and college students seem the most likely users to access this generally available content; social workers will primarily be looking for information on their LA intranets.

### Proposed approach

Since this is information not guidance, I think the best way to think about the content itself is to identify the questions it needs to answer for users. I think these are

- **What** is an ASYE?  Description in general terms that will apply to most, if not necessarily all, LA ASYE provision
- **Who** can take an ASYE?
- **Why** do we expect social workers to complete an ASYE – what is the purpose of the exercise? Why should I be glad to do it rather than rolling my eyes at it?
- **How** is an ASYE delivered – examinations, course work, assessment, supervision...? What’s the workload, and will it interfere with my actual job?
- **How** is success or failure measured and evaluated?

The content needs to be short, to the point, plain English, jargon free and, ideally, reassuring.
