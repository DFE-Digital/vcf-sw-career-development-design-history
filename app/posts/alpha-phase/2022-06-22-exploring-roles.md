## When
Sprint: Sprint 2
When: 27 June 2022 - 2 July 2022

## Overview / user needs

> **Discovery report**: Career journeys are varied and complicated, with variation between structures in LAs. Users struggle to understand whatâ€™s on offer and how to progress.

Based on the user need for more information about roles within social work, we explored presenting job roles. Some social work job roles are held on the National Careers Service, so rather than duplicate effort, we looked to provide more detailed information that social workers might not get elsewhere. This included:

- Other similar job roles with different titles.
- Where the job role sits within the career pathway - note: the pathway presented was more aligned to the pathway presented in the Induction pack (based on BASW) rather than the DfE one at this stage.
- Requirements for the role. This could be skills, experience and training/CPD completed.
- Additional guidance on how to reach the role (i.e. how to become one).

## Design thinking
We experimented with using a couple of different content page styles. We started with the mainstream guide template included with the .gov prototype kit. We quickly decided this would not meet our needs for presenting the information as we wanted. Our second draft was based around a content page on the <a href="https://professional-development-for-teachers-leaders.education.gov.uk" target="_blank">DfE professional development for teachers website</a>. We liked the summary of information at the top and the simplicity of the layout.

Information relating to where the role sat within the career pathway was presented in an aside.

NB: Content was not provided for this concept and placeholder text was used. We struggled to find anything beyond the basic social worker job description. Edit: Further investigation was carried out during the [career pathways sprint](/alpha-phase/the-career-pathway-concept/).

## What happened next?
The concept **was** shown and tested (not usability testing) with users during Round 3 research sessions.
