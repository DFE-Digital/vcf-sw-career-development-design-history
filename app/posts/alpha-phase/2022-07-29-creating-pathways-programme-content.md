## When
Sprint: Sprint 7
When: 25 July 2022 - 30 July 2022

## Background

Pathways is a series of ‘multiple bespoke pathways for four levels of social worker role’.

- The programme will launch in October 2022.
- It was commissioned and funded by the DfE, but is being created and delivered by Frontline.
- DfE have no subject matter experts in this area, and the material they have provided me to create content from is only what was used to solicit bids for the contract.
- I have been referred to the Frontline website for information. It is a zendesk collection of FAQs, and doesn’t provide much concrete info. <a href="https://thefrontline.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/5736051484957-Pathways-programme" target="_blank">https://thefrontline.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/5736051484957-Pathways-programme</a>

### User needs

It seems clear at this stage that any user needs will be met by Frontline’s full Pathways website when it launches. There is no point duplicating their information on our page, so our page will, at best, be a brief high level selection of basic facts. But, as yet, we cannot even provide that.

### Business needs

As explained to me by Xane:

- The Pathways page will be part of the DfE Social Work Career Development site, alongside ASYE and UPON.
- At some point in the future (timescale unknown), both ASYE and UPON will require users to visit this site to complete an online assessment (nature unknown), which will drive traffic to the site.
- The DfE wants these users to notice the page for Pathways, which will inform them about its existence. This is the **first business need** for the page.
- Also, the delivery contract for Pathways comes up for review in 2024. At that stage, if the contract does not go to Frontline, the DfE will require the new deliverer to use this DfE Pathways page as the repository for all information about the programme. Having this page ready for that future time is the **second business need**.

### Conclusion

After talking all this through with Xane it was agreed that

- He would put me in touch with his boss, Jo, who procured the contract, who may be able to provide me with more details about the programme
- He would put me in touch with the team building Frontline’s website, so we can be sure to align terminology and info
- **Initially, the only content needed for this page is a paragraph or two that is very high level and basically says ‘Coming soon…’**
