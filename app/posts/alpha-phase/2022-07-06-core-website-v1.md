## When
Sprint: Sprint 4
When: 5 - 9 July 2022

## Overview / user needs

As covered in the [exploring information architect post](/alpha-phase/exploring-information-architecture/), we already had a good view of the basic business requirement for the service. At this point, we began designing what would be called the core website. This consisted of:

- Homepage
- ASYE content page
- ASYE alternative content page
- Upon content page
- Pathways content page
- DfE future things content page
- DfE Role in social work content page

## Design thinking

We also designed an alternative ASYE content page. Why? Again, at this point we had no content, so decided to create a simple content page and an alternative to accommodate larger amounts of text by using accordions.

We stuck with the simple card designs for the homepage and the `< Back` nav for each of the pages. For the future things page, we used a scaled down version of the 'mainstream guide template' included with the .gov prototype kit. Again, without knowing what the content on this page would look like, this felt like a good compromise. In future versions, it maybe that the future things section uses separate pages for each 'thing'.

NB: Content was not provided for this concept and placeholder text was used.

## What happened next?
The concept **was not** shown to, or tested with users.
