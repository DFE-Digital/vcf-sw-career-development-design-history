## When
Sprint: Sprint 5
When: 12 - 16 July 2022

## Overview / user needs
Round 1 research sessions were conducted during the previous sprint. Based on the following findings, we created an alternate version of the homepage:

> **Round 1 findings report**: Social workers don't know what 'national' or DfE programmes might be.

### Key findings

- All Social workers interpreted 'development programmes' differently, it is not a term they use internally
- Many aren't familiar with PSDP, PLDP or Upon when prompted

- See <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EtLZcg8hK8OiG6w83g7ANOz3r91yz-IZzwv8gKTVWf0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">DSWDC Alpha Round 1 UR Findings report (opens in new tab)</a> for more detail.

## Design thinking

Based on the above findings, we iterated the homepage as follows:

{{ appGallery({
  items: [{
    text: "prototype homepage v1",
    caption: "The original homepage v1."
  }, {
    text: "prototype homepage alt by roles v1",
    caption: "The iterated homepage based on role level"
  }]
}) }}

### Specific design changes

- Changed the main section heading to imply 'progression programmes'
- Repositioned the programmes based on the user role level, e.g. frontline or management

We felt that there might be further user needs around the presentation of the DfE programmes. This was explored in the round 2 research sessions, but we did not use these designs, preferring to have the user describe the terms and positioning of training programmes.


## What happened next?
The concept **was not** shown to, or tested with users at this stage. Further research was conducted in the Round 2 research sessions.
