<strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--turquoise">Core website</strong>

## When
Sprint: Sprint 1
When: 10 - 17 June 2022

## Overview
It was clear that the service would likely be a standalone website. A flexible homepage was required to surface the various business requirements.

## Design thinking
Without any visibility of user needs or content from DfE, we created a couple of homepage concepts. Both designed around the business need to present the following content items:

- DfE development programmes
  - ASYE
  - Upon
  - New programme - replacing the PLP (PLDP/PSDP programmes)
- A route to the assessment and accreditation programme
- Career guidance (exact requirements undefined at this stage)
- Routes to professional standards
- A place for DfE to announce future things
- Additional resources (exact requirements undefined at this stage)

Additionally, to provide a route into some of the concepts we had designed:

- Career tool
- CPD tool

Although we had already agreed to not use card components with imagery, the 2nd concept did use the to show how it might look if we chose that approach later.

NB: Content was not provided for this concept and placeholder text was used.

## What happened next?
These concept **were not** shown to, or tested with users.
