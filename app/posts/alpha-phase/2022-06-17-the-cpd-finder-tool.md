## When
Sprint: Sprint 1
When: 10 June 2022 - 17 June 2022

## Overview
The discovery report highlights that users generally have no trouble finding CPD that meet their needs.

> **Discovery report**: Generally users donâ€™t struggle to find CPD which meets their needs, but completing CPD is not the only important factor in career progression.

Despite this, there **was** a user need for a complete view of CPDs available in one place. Additionally, the concept of showing which CPDs may help towards career progression. We decided it was a worthwhile exercise to create a quick concept to user in research sessions.

## Design thinking
We decided on 2 approaches for exposing CPD offerings to users:

1. Via a search and filter page where users can identify CPDs meeting their needs - designed in this sprint.
2. Via a question and recommendation approach - designed in sprint 2

Edit: This was very high-level thinking at this stage. We determined the DfE development programmes to be CPDs and included them in this tool.

### Design approach
The search and filter is roughly based on the gov.uk faceted search pages used for content such as Research and Statistics, and Policy papers and consultations. The results are fed from a .json file containing the CPD courses.

Given the basic level of this concept, none of the search or filtering elements work. There is no pagination of the results.

## What happened next?
The concept **was not** shown to, or tested with users. Subsequent conversations with the business show no desire to provide a service like this.
