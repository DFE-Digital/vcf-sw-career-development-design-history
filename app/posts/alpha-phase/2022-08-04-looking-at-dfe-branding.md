<strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--yellow">Design and branding</strong>

## When
Sprint: Sprint 8
When: 1 - 6 August 2022
Posted by: Jonathan Porton

## Overview / user needs
The new guidance in the <a href="https://design.education.gov.uk/branding.html" target="_blank">Design in DfE resource</a> outlines the steps to brand a service on .education.gov.uk.

Based on this, we added this to the prototype. This version is currently **not** live.

## Design thinking
We added the supplied CSS to the prototype. The current prototype uses dynamic headers based on the page (a variable is passed into a layout page, which calls an include file with each header version).

The resulting branding looks like this:

### Homepage with gov container hero
<a href="prototype-homepage-concept-dfe-brand-2.png" target="_blank">![Homepage with full-width hero](prototype-homepage-concept-dfe-brand-1.png "Homepage with full-width hero")</a>

### Homepage with full-width hero
<a href="prototype-homepage-concept-dfe-brand-2.png" target="_blank">![Homepage with full-width hero](prototype-homepage-concept-dfe-brand-2.png "Homepage with full-width hero")</a>

## What needs to happen now?
An agreement is required on where the service will be hosted. The use of the DfE branding needs to be reviewed if the project goes to beta.
