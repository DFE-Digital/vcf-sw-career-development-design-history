## When
Sprint: Sprint Alpha Planning
When: 24 May 2022 - 7 June 2022

## Overview
Based on the business requirements and outputs from the Crazy 8 workshop, we were able to create a basic information architecture for the service.

## Design thinking

At this stage, we had little visibility of potential content for the service. We knew that the business requirement was to have overview pages that linked to the partner websites for each of the development programmes. What we did not know, was how much information users would require. The following was decided:

- Create a flat website structure.
- Design a sub-level navigation page to use if required.
- Remove any top-level navigation options.
- Use card components and back links to allow navigation.
- Provide 'related' links in an aside block on each programme page.

To bring the site map concept alive, a set of flow components were designed. This enabled easy creation of user journeys/flows without designing lots of real pages.

## Design tasks completed

- Create a site map.
- Adapt .gov.uk flow components to suit our needs (which meant new pages and components).

## What happened next?

The site map was used to inform the design of the core website v1. The flow components were used to ideate several concepts including the career pathway.
