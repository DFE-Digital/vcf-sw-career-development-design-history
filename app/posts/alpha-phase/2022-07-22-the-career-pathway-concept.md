## When
Sprint: Sprint 6 and 7
When: 19 July 2022 - 23 July 2022 / 25 July 2022 - 30 July 2022

## Overview / user needs

> **Discovery report**: Career journeys are varied and complicated, with variation between structures in LAs. Users struggle to understand whatâ€™s on offer and how to progress.

One of the biggest user needs identified in both the discovery phase and alpha research sessions was around career progression. A number of user needs and opportunities were highlighted:

### User needs
- As a social worker, I need to understand the exact steps I can take towards my next role, so that I can prepare for it in the most effective way.
- As a social worker, I need to feel confident that the role I am moving into is the right fit for me personally,	so that I can fully commit to preparing for the change and avoid disappointment.
- As a social worker, I need to understand how to use my existing knowledge and experience for career progression, so that I can make the most of it.

### Opportunities
- Social workers recognise the link between training and career progression.
- Help SWs understand what a possible career in C&F SW may look like through frameworks and case studies.
- Help SWs reach a longer-term career goal by helping with a long-term plan.
- Help navigate career options by recommending roles that could suit the SW personally.
- Social workers want to see real life examples of careers and cases, and connect with real people from their profession.
- They are interested in opportunities to exchange information and experiences that are relevant to them personally.

### Business requirements
- Social workers can see national level guidance / information about career pathways and roles.
- Social workers can read information about career development opportunities at different stages of their career.
- Social workers can click through to other resources e.g. the gov.uk social worker blog pages, PCF, SWE etc.

Additionally, the business provided diagrams showing the current and future DfE career pathways:

## Design thinking
We started by approaching the concept as a completely separate entity from the rest of the website. We used the current DfE career pathway structure (above) as a guide and created this structure:

#### Career pathway page flow
<a href="career-pathway.png" target="_blank">![Career pathway structure](career-pathway.png "Career pathway structure")</a>

The theory being that users could jump into any level of the pathway but would likely choose the level of the pathway.

### Pathway page
We used arrows on the pathway page to denote the concept of linear progression.

### Level pages
We know users need to understand the steps they need to take to progress to another level of their career. We chose to use the gov.uk step by step template for this approach. Although the user might need to complete these steps over a period of time, we felt this was a good fit. As per our other approaches, we reviewed DfE services to see if anyone was using the component in a similar way. We found a similar use on the <a href="https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Manage training for early careers teachers</a> where the steps outlined would also need to be completed over a longer time period.

Depending on how well that concept tested, we had alternate approaches thought out, for instance:
- using just accordions components but not as linear steps to complete or;
- displaying each step visible on the page.

Further testing is required to determine the best approach.

The steps were based on user research. We looked at all of the findings around career progression:

<a href="career-pathway-findings-summary.png" target="_blank">![Career progression findings](career-pathway-findings-summary.png "Career progression findings")</a>

and produced a basic wireframe of how a page might be structured:

<a href="career-pathway-basic-wireframe.png" target="_blank">![Career progression wireframe](career-pathway-basic-wireframe.png "Career progression wireframe")</a>

Ultimately designing a level page like this:

<a href="prototype-career-pathway-ps-expanded.png" target="_blank">![Practice supervisor level page](prototype-career-pathway-ps-expanded.png "Practice supervisor level page")</a>

#### In each step
The user would have a series of links to either content on the service, or to trusted 3rd party services such as the National Careers Service.

> One of the key elements was a link to relevant DfE development programmes.

### Header design
We used a full-width header on these pages. We needed an area that summarised the level along with key information related to that level. Links to relevant social work frameworks were added along with consistent navigation links allowing the user to step through each level without having to return to the main pathways page.

### Job roles
At this point, we were unsure at what level the journey should be presented at - our choices were:

1. High-level. E.g.
DfE pathways headings (Practitioner > Practice supervisor etc.) or alternatives such as BASWs career pathway (Social worker > Experienced social worker etc.) or;
2. Lower level using actual job titles. E.g.
Social worker > Senior social worker > Team manager etc.

In the end we chose option 1. Why? Our BA (and several other team members) had spent time researching online to find generic descriptions at the lower level without much success. Also, we discovered through research that there is little consistency of job titles.

To aid with users recognising their level, we added a list of relevant job titles and job activities. As we already had a job role page from a previous sprint, we adapted that and linked directly from the levels page.

NB: Content was not provided for this concept and placeholder text was used, except where some meaningful text was required.

## What happened next?
The concept **was** shown to in the Round 3 research sessions. The following findings were identified:
