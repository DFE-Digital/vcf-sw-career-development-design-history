## When
Sprint: Sprint 5
When: 12 July 2022 - 16 July 2022

## Overview / user needs
Up to this point, the core website was 7 pages with placeholder text. During this sprint we added content for the ASYE and Upon pages.

## Design thinking
This was a minor iteration, populating the ASYE and Upon pages with real content. We also added the same content to the alternate version. The content was not written specifically for this template, however we wanted to show both versions to users.

## What happened next?
The ASYE (both versions) and Upon content pages **were** used for research in the Round 2 research sessions.
